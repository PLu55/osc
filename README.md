Racket bindings for OSC

This library provides the means for racket programs to act as OSC clients.
More specifically, it provides functions to produce OSC message and bundle
byte-strings, and to parse those byte-strings back into OSC elements.

This fork has extended the number of data types that can be used.

To install, follow the standard instructions for installing packages:

raco pkg install osc

(or navigate through the "Install Package..." menus)
